# NassiPy-Development-of-Nassi-Shneiderman-DIagram-to-Python-Converter

Welcome to NassiPy ! We aim to help newbies with little no experience in programming using Nassi-Shneiderman Diagram with its easy to follow top to down approach.

However, there are still limitations to this project. The following limitations are:
1. There's no limitation for the current NSD maker (unlimited diagram)
2. Each diagram represent a new line, so there's no additional line after a break statement
3. There's no leaderboard system
