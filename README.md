# NassiPy-Development-of-Nassi-Shneiderman-DIagram-to-Python-Converter

Welcome to NassiPy ! We aim to help newbies with little no experience in programming using Nassi-Shneiderman Diagram with its easy to follow top to down approach.

However, there are still limitations to this project. The following limitations are:
1. There's no limitation for the current NSD maker (unlimited diagram)
2. E̶a̶c̶h̶ d̶i̶a̶g̶r̶a̶m̶ r̶e̶p̶r̶e̶s̶e̶n̶t̶ a̶ n̶e̶w̶ l̶i̶n̶e̶, s̶o̶ t̶h̶e̶r̶e̶'s̶ n̶o̶ a̶d̶d̶i̶t̶i̶o̶n̶a̶l̶ l̶i̶n̶e̶ a̶f̶t̶e̶r̶ a̶ b̶r̶e̶a̶k̶ s̶t̶a̶t̶e̶m̶e̶n̶t̶
3. There's no leaderboard system
